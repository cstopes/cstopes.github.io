  <h1>"Just One Life" Road Safety Awareness Exhibition</h1>
    <p>This road safety presentation bombarded us with shock advertising, shocking stories and shocking images to get through to us
    the extreme importance of road safety. It got that point across deafeningly load and crystal clear.</p>
    <p>I know now things which I had already known: don't drink and drive, don't drive when tired, don't speed.
    However, the exhibition did teach me things I didn't realise. Things such as not driving when people are messing in
    the back, and not driving while angry. I know now that I will be a safer road user than I was before, out of fear for my life and the lives of those around me.</p>

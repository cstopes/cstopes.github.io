<h1>Uisce</h1>
  <p>Uisce was one of the most fun activities in TY. It was great to be able to get away to the West for a weekend with all of my friends! We had a lot of activities in our three days at Uisce, such as surfing, kayaking, archery, and of course learning some great circus skills! I could have learned a lot of Irish there, but there were no strict rules concerning speaking Irish, so I rarely made an effort. The environment in Uisce was very laid-back and friendly, but frantic and piled with activity at the same time. If I am to go to a Gaeltacht summer camp again, I'm sure I will go to Uisce.</p>

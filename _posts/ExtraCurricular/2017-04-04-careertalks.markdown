    <h1>Subject Choice Talks</h1>
      <p>The subject choice advisory talks by the prefects this year were extremely useful. They certainly helped me decide which subjects I was to do.</p>
      <h3>Sciences</h3>
        <p>I was sure that I wanted to do two sciences, both because I love science and because I know a science course in most universities require two science subjects. I was also 90% sure I would do chemistry and physics. The talk on biology made me completely sure that I would do chemistry and physics; the prefect did a great job explaining what studying the material was like (was it rote learning or understanding that mattered more?), and the way biology was to be studied did not suit me.</p>
      <h3>Businesses</h3>
        <p>I wasn't sure whether I would like to do a business subject, as I knew that business subjects generally weren't required to pursue careers in business. However, I wanted to do either one business subject or DCG. I was fascinated by both accounting and economics, but I was not sure.</p>
        <p>I chose accounting because the prefects told us that everyone who does accounting loves it, and that economics is generally enjoyed more by people who loved current affairs. This made accounting my business subject of choice; as I loved it in junior cert and found it easier to study than rote-learned definitions, a big part of economics.</p>
      <h3>DCG</h3>
        <p>Because of the subjects I had already chosen, I knew I had a choice between DCG and accounting. In the DCG talk, I was told that 40% of the final result would be obtained through the project, in which you would try to invent or design a new product by studying and replicating existing products. This talk pulled me toward doing DCG, before I realised that I wasn't that fond of using SolidWorks, or studying the mechanical properties of, for example, taps.</p>

  <h1>Spectrum, EirQuest and DAT Assessments</h1>
    <p>I completed two assessments this year: EirQuest, a compulsory assessment that everyone completed, and Spectrum, an optional test. I completed the DAT tests last year and was receiving the results of those tests this year. All of these assessments were intended to help me pick my Leaving Cert subjects wisely, and to help me decide what career I might pursue.</p>
    <h2>EirQuest</h2>
      <p>The EirQuest assessment was an examination of our personal interest levels for each career type. I cannot remember what the questionnaire consisted of, but questions like 'would you like a job where...' and 'do you like...' were included. The result of this questionnaire confirmed my interest in mathematics, physics, and sport, but surprised me by telling me I would also be highly interested in a career in chemistry, or computing. I was also told that electronic engineering and administrative careers were an overall match to my interests.</p>
      <p>I liked the EirQuest test as it gave me a lot of options and didn't put me into a box, or give me one career choice that I should probably go with. Basically, it supported my confirmation bias regarding a career in maths or science.</p>
    <h2>Spectrum</h2>
      <p>The Spectrum assessment was personality based, and focussed on what job we would <em>like</em> to do. It focussed on our behaviours and motivators, and showed us our 'natural styles' and 'motivating factors'. I was told that my style is dominant and that my top three motivating factors were knowledge and discovery, leadership, and return on investment. I was also therefore told that a career in administration would suit me.</p>
      <p>I did not like this assessment because it seemed to put individuals into boxes. I was a 'red' person, the person next to me was a 'blue', the person the other side of me was nothing like me but was also a 'red'. Apparently, 'reds' need to be approached with facts or decisions or a plan, when I am perfectly fine being approached with a "How are you doing?". Also, this assessment didn't conform to my confirmation bias which tells me that anyone advising me to become a scientist must be right and everyone else isn't so correct. At least I am aware of this bias, right?</p>
    <h2>DAT Assessments</h2>
      <p>I cannot fully remember my DAT scores, but I remember what I was good at and what I was not. I was very strong in abstract reasoning, mechanical reasoning, numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, vocabulary and grammar. I was weak at spacial reasoning, which is odd, because I earned an A at Junior Cert level technical graphics. I chose subjects to play to my strengths; I didn't choose DCG due to my lack of spatial reasoning skills and chose physics, chemistry, and accounting to match my numerical, mechanical and abstract reasoning skills.</p>

  <h1>Spectrum, EirQuest and DAT Assessments</h1>
    <p>I completed two assessments this year: EirQuest, a compulsory assessment that everyone completed, and Spectrum, an optional test. I completed the DAT tests last year and was receiving the results of those tests this year. All of these assessments were intended to help me pick my Leaving Cert subjects wisely, and to help me decide what career I might pursue.,/p>

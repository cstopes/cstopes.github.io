<h1>Retreat, Castletown</h1>
  <p>On March 21st, TYC and TYD went on a retreat to Castletown, County Laois. The object of the retreat in my opinion was to try to learn more about ourselves and our schoolmates. The theme of the retreat was to realise how special ourselves are, and to love ourselves more.</p>
  <p>I found the retreat mostly boring; we had all of the same sort of talks that we had in previous years, and if I'm faced with another activity where we write nice things about each other I might seriously consider getting up and walking out of ther room. The one interesting discussion we had was when the supervisor was a devout Catholic and most of the group were having doubts or were firm non-believers. In said discussion, we basically challenged the supervisor's whole belief system (with logic and composure and without trying to be mean) and made her quite upset by the end of it. I found this discussion interesting as it showed me how fragile theism really is, and that mkore and more people are doubting religion.</p>
  <p>The day was alright, and I actually think I learned something from it. I can't remember how the thought came to me, but I realised I had to become a better, kinder, more sympathetic person. I have been trying to act on this notion ever since, with some success.</p>

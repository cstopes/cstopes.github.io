<h1>Rape Crisis Centre Talk</h1>
  <p>The talk we got from the rape crisis centre was very informative, even though I was only present for half of it. It taught us first about consent, and that a person cannot consent when they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It also taught us that somewhat bewilderingly, a person can say that they consent, under no alcoholic or drug influences, and can then still not actually have given consent, resulting in a lawsuit against the offender. This taught me to be very careful about sexual consent, but also left me with the question as to how I should know if anyone is really giving consent. I also learned that I, as a male, am automatically more likely to be prosecuted for sexual assault than a female, which I found completely outrageous but also quite helpful in regard to how careful I need to be regarding this issue.</p>
  <p>We were then told always to get help, even if it is not from the police, if we ever feel sexually assaulted. We were also given advice on what do to if somebody comes to you for help.</p>

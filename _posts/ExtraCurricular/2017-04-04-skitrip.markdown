<h1>Ski Trip</h1>
  <body>
    <p>I loved every minute of the TY ski trip (well, maybe except breakfast). It was definitely the best bweek of my life; every day was an exciting new challenge. I had a great time with my friends, I was amazing on the slopes, the night-time was fun, and the teachers were laid-back. I couldn't have asked for a better school tour really (well, maybe except breakfast).</p>
    <p>The hotel was very good; they gave us plenty of food, the rooms were quite spacious and cosy, the lobby was also very spacious, making for an easy night-time experience, and the breakfast was edible. Since the wi-fi was terrible in the lobby, we all got the chance to sit around tables and play cards with each other; a superb way to connect with each other and to eliminate boredom.</p>
    <p>The ski resort was fantastic; I found the slopes quite suitable for a beginner; easy to master and very wide. The ski-park was my favourite slope! I started out as a beginner this year, and was able to tackle a black slope by the end of the trip, courtesy of our brilliant instructor Giaccomo.</p>
    <p>The weather and scenery could only add to the fantastic, once in a lifetime trip.</p>

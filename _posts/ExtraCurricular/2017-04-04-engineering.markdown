  <h1>Engineering Your Future Week, IT Tallaght</h1>
    <p>I participated in the engineering week because my Dad nagged me about it for quite some time. Before that week I had no intention of studying engineering; it seemed quite boring and repetitive compared to science. Now, engineering may be one of my backup choices on the CAO.</p>
    <p>This week made engineering fun for me. We completed fun and testing challenges such as catapult building, rocket crafting, robot programming, computer programming and building an FM radio. These activities showed me a lot about engineering. It taught me that how engineers approach a task is quite simple: think outside the box, find innovative solutions to the problem, and then find an even better solution. To me, innovation seems like quite a fun job. This has put engineering in my mind for a future career.</p>
    <p>The engineering week was a lot of fun, as well as educational. I would recommend it to any Transition Year student, whether or not they are open to engineering as a career path.</p>

  <h1>Leinster Driving Academy</h1>
    <p>The day at Leinster Driving Academy was extremely useful. It was my first experience driving and I think I can say now that I have a rudimentary grasp of moving a vehicle forwards with little speed and no sharp bends. The instructor was very helpful, and was very patient with my quite terrible motor skills.</p>
    <p>I learned at the driving academy that I should take my theory test very soon, as there will be new questions released very soon, and I do not want to study more than I have to. Also, in the mock theory test I scored 38 out of 40. I therefore think I am well able to sit a theory test an begin driving very soon.</p>

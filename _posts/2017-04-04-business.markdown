  <p>The learning experience of this year's business curriculuum was largely attributed to the 'Mini-Company' experience. 
  
  I had mixed feelings about my mini-company project: I felt like a lot of the best ideas (admittedly, mainly my ideas) weren't being considered at the beginning. I realised I knew nothing about how to manipulate people and make them think that the ideas you have are a good idea; a vital skill in the world of management that I will need to improve (I was CEO of the mini-company). 
  
  We decided on stealing someone else's idea and printing Newbridge College jerseys for rugby and hockey players. Unfortunately, communications with our partner broke down and we had only two weeks to arrange a new product to bring to market.
  
  We sold chocolate hampers along with a customizable mug at the fair. This product waxs easy to make, and I enjoyed the experience of frantically putting them together the night before the fair! The selling day was also very fun, and I realised that I am not too bad a salesperson! 
  
  Our group made a <strong>100% return on investment</strong>. This was a success for us, but we were never going to win any prizes. 
  
  Through mini-company, I learned that my general <strong>management skills</strong> needed to be improved upon and that I shouldn't overthink everything. The chocolate hampers were a novelty idea that nevertheless was successful.

  <p>otherwise, business was an interesting subject in my opinion. Ms. Clear taught us about a lot of interesting topics concerning the economics of current affairs, much of which linked back to the economics curriculum.

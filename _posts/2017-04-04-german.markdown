<h1>German</h1>

  <p>I had Ms. Heinz for German this year. This year I do not think that my German has improved, which is a shame because I am doing it at higher level for Leaving Cert. The first half of our year in German consisted of watching 'Deutschland 83', a German TV series about Cold War Germany. This taught me about what the German divide was like at the time.<br>The rest of our year consisted of attempting activities in the TY German workbook. This wasn't very beneficial as we didn't actually <em>learn</em> any new words that we saw, and we didn't improve our grammar at all.<br>This year, I should have worked by myself to improve my German, but I didn't take that opportunity. Therefore, I may have even gotten worse at German than I was at Junior Cert level. However, I will still take on German for my Leaving Cert, because I learned that I will probably need a foreign language as a minimum requirement for any course I might take on in university.</p>

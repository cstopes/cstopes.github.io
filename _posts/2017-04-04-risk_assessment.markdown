<h1>Risk Assessment</h1>
  <p>In risk assessment this year, we learned plenty about how to keep a building safe, including requirements such as high fences, a gap of less than six inches underneath gates, outward-opening hinges on outside doors and strategic positioning of valuable items. We were promised that we would learn more about forensics and criminology if we had completed the full eight classes in this subject.</p>

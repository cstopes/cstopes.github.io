    <p>I had Ms. Hearne for English, and quite enjoyed my year. We had plenty of creative work to do, which I loved. I personally like writing compositions, and I think that I improved on my writing in general this year.</p>
    <p>As well as plenty of writing, Ms. Hearne also took me and five others from TY to a debate in the Kildare County Council chambers, which I had to write a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/162Ly3TJVNX9mefZTIhrcY2rgqJ2EXqkBef9k17bpR2U/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">speech</a> for. This was a great experience, as I love debating, and I got some insight into what the life of a politician/council member is like.</p>

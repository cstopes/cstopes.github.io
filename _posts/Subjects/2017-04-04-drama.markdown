<h1>Drama</h1>
<body>
  <p>Drama was definitely the most fun class of the year!! While I learned next to nothing (I was always fearless at standing up in front of people and making an eejit of myself), I had lots of fun! We often had to plan our own sketches, use improvisation and read from real scripts. We also tried to make a short film, which failed badly. drama also inspired meto take part in the musical and variety show from now on, even though I can't sing or dance. I had forgotten how fun it was just to perform <em>anything</em> in front of people!</p>

  <h1>Art</h1>
  <p>I had Ms. Holmes for art this year. Art was a subject in which I didn't learn anything valuable to my school career or future career: I am not choosing art for the Leaving Certificate, and any artistic techniques I learned, I will likely not use again. However, creating a project - both as a team and individually - was an enjoyable and satisfying experience. I completed three projects in art this year:

    <li><a href = "/pictures/">"Op-Art"</a></li>
    </ul>

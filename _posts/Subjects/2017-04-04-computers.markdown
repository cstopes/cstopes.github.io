  <h1>Computers</h1>
    <p>Computers was definitely my most practical subject of the year, and the one where I learned the most.</p>
    <p>Until February, I was focussed on completing the European Computer Driving License (ECDL) course, which taught me skills in all the main areas of computer literacy (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook, general Windows 7 skills, general online skills and online collaboration skills). I found myself to be naturally good at these tests, as I had used computers extensively in the past. I learned a lot, however, in the area of databases and Microsoft Access. It was an application that I had never used before and one that I may have to use in the future, so it was great to form a basic understanding of databases.</p>
    <p>I finished the ECDL course very quickly; completing all seven tests by February. After February, I focussed on coding. I had already completed a course in HTML and CSS in 2016, and I began to learn coding in JavaScript. This is what gave me the idea to set up a website as my portfolio. I completed most of my JavaScript course, but unfortunately had to stop to design this website. I am now fond of coding, and I hope to use coding in the future; as a hobby or as my job.</p>

    <p>Mr. Newsome and Mr. Burke were my science teachers. We learned a few interesting things in science this year. We studied optics, motion, sports injuries, space travel, and structural engineering among other things, and completed multiple projects.</p>
    <p>Science class didn't do much to help me choose my science subjects for next year; I had already decided that I would be picking chemistry and physics. This is because I want to study science in third-level.</p>

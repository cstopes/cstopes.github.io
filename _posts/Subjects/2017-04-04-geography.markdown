<h1>Geography</h1>
<body>
  <p>For some reason, I missed a lot of Thursdays this year, especially the second half of Thursdays. For this reason, I didn't have much geography class. However, this did not mean no work was done. Mr. Cash set us a really fun assignment: we had to plan a holiday with a budget of â‚¬5000. This gave me good knowledge of how travelling works in real life, and how far money could take me if I wanted to travel.</p>
  <p>The rest of geography was spent watching geography documentaries. 'An Inconvenient Truth' taught us about the huge problem of rapid climate change, for example.</p>
  <p>I was never going to choose geography for Leaving Cert, so this subject was not important to me in Transtion Year.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<body>
  <p>History was a good subject this year. We were busy, despite how disjointed our class was (our history class was one of the most broken-up of all). The first half of the year was spent learning about modern social changes in history; we spent a lot of time looking at changes in music, television, pop culture, fashion and film over the decades. I completed a project on the 1960s.<br>The rest of the year was quite broken-up, due to how many Thursdays we seemed to miss as a class. It seemed that most TY events or school events that took place were at last class before break on a Thursday!<br>One theme we covered was history's most influential person. We had to complete a small essay on this person and why their influence was the second greatest in history (we were not allowed to pick Jesus Christ). This was a good project in that I had to research through many different sources.<br>History was a very interesting subject this year, and it is a shame I didn't have more history classes to enjoy.</p>

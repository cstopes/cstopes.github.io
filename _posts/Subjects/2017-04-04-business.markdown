<h1>Business</h1>

  <p>The learning experience of this year's business curriculum was largely attributed to the <a href = "/2017/04/04/minicompany.html">mini-company</a> project that I undertook. The mini-company project lasted from September to January this year.</p> 
  <p>Otherwise, business was an interesting subject, in my opinion. Ms. Clear taught us about a lot of interesting topics concerning the economics of current affairs, much of which linked back to the economics curriculum. We watched plenty of videos (an example being a documentary about the Federal Reserve in America), and talked about current affairs such as the housing crisis.</p>
  <p>I have chosen accounting for my Leaving Cert. Unfortunately, only one day was devoted to accounting this year, as Ms. Clear was definitely not an accounting teacher. I was struggling to decide between accounting and economics, but Ms. Clear helped steer me onto the right path, in my opinion. She told me to just do what I want because I am well capable of "getting the points" in either subject (I do not want to pursue a business or accounting career). I was convinced to choose accounting because it is rare that a student loves accounting - which I do - and is not good at it at leaving cert level.</p>
  <p>I enjoyed and gained something out of doing business studies this year, both on personal and academic levels.</p>

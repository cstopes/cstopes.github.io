<h1>Religion</h1>
<body>
  <p>Religion surprised me this year. I was expecting, and looking forward to, learning about different religions and cultures, realising different world views, etc. However, in religion this year <strong>I learned next to nothing about religion</strong>. At first, I thought that this was completely counter-productive and I wasn't happy. However, the content of this class taught me more than I could have ever learned through a normal religion class.</p>
  <p>This class was a <strong>restorative practices</strong>(or "circle time") class. We sat in a circle and talked, often deeply, about life, about or feelings and opinions, and about our world. The reason this taught me so much is because I would normally have been arrogant, and would have thought my way is right and an illogical, over-emotional way of thinking was wrong.</p>
  <p>I would still often think that, however I now empathise with people, and see their point of view. This is a great attribute for me that I wouldn't have had in abundance before this year.</p>
  <p>We did next to no written work this year, however I still learned a lot.</p>

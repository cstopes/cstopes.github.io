    <h1>Socio-Political Education</h1>
    <p>Mr. Newsome taught us in socio-political education this year. We had no written work in this class and we took no notes. In this class we learned about colonisation and revolution among other things. I did not attend the full eight classes because there were often other things happening in school in that time on a Thursday (career talks, presentations, etc.).</p>

<h1>DCG and Woodwork</h1>
<body>
  <p>I found DCG to be a productive subject this year only from a subject choice point of view. I loved Techical Graphics in Junior Cert, and I excelled in it. I was therefore strongly recommended and strongly inclined towards DCG. I was also told that having a knowledge in the software that engineers use would give me a head-start in university, should I pursue a career in engineering.</p><br>
  <p>I found out that DCG required a project in which I would have to design and develop a product. While this seemed appealing, I realised it would be a lot of hard work during an important time for revision. I also didn't like the idea of studying, for instance, <strong>taps</strong>for a few months.</p><br>
  <p>Also, I found the SolidWorks interface very easy to grasp, so I figured I wouldn't need knowledge of it before entering university. I also was convinced that I would go down the path of science rather than engineering, so I decided against taking the subject.</p>
  <p>The DCG class itself was quite interesting; we completed many projects and I enjoyed my last time using my talents in technical graphics. The Woodwork class was completely counter-productive; I have always been terrible at woodwork, anfd I didn't complete my project.</p>

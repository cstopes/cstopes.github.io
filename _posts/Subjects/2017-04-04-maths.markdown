  <p>Maths was a really enjoyable subject this year, and one where I can truly say I learned a lot that will help me in fifth year. I feel as though I have gotten a head start over anyone going straight from third year to fifth year. I truly loved working on maths this year; I even entertained the possibility of working on maths by myself at home, but didn't follow through with the idea. Topics that I improved upon included functions, factorising, fractions, algebra, integers, statistics and probability, and mental arithmetic and calculations.</p>

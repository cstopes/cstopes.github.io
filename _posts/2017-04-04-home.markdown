<h1>Cooking (<strong>NOT</strong> Home Economics!!!)</h1>
<body>
  <p>Cooking class was quite a productive class. I learned a lot of new recipes that could be quite useful for me to use when noodles aren't an option in university. Some recipes included:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Steak and Pepper Sauce</li>
  <li>Chicken Stir Fry</li>
  <li>Chicken Risotto</li>
  <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
  <li>Victoria Sponge</li>
  </ul>
